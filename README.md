# PRS (Proposal Registry System)
This Project aims to simplify the process of registering students' academic proposals.<br>
Users (students, supervisor, ...) can sign in to the system. then based on thier role
students can compose a proposal and send it to intended supervisors.
supervisors can view the proposal and see if it's fit or not.
